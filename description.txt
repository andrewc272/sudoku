A project I found interesting and useful for learning about data structures and pointers and file IO is sudoku solver
	generator. You can solve it many different ways. Recursive backtracking (with or without heuristics), using arrays
	(single or multidimensional), trees, linked lists, etc. As a non-recursive state machine. As an exact cover problem (see
	dancing links.) You can create your solve() method to accept a solve function as a function pointer. You can use this
	project to learn about project tools like make, cmake, autotools, unit test frameworks, timing tools, gdb, valgrind, git,
	etc..
